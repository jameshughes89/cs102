The main focus of this course is:

* The organization and manipulation of data
* Organize data into collections, such as

    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Bags
    * Trees

* How to implement various data structures
* Algorithm Analysis



Data Structures
===============

* A data structure is some *structure* used to store, organize, and manage data


Linear Data Structures
----------------------

* A *linear data structure* is one where the data is stored in a line
* Generally, everything has one thing that comes before it (predecessor) and one thing that comes after it (successor)


Stacks
^^^^^^

* Like a stack of plates
* The last thing put on top of the stack will be the first thing off

.. figure:: /topics/stacks/stack_example.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    Adding a plate to the top of a stack of plates.


Queues
^^^^^^

* Like any line you've ever waited in
* First person in the line will be the first person served

.. figure:: /topics/queues/queue_example.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    A first come first served queue/line.


Bags
^^^^

* Like Python lists, but we can define specific types

    * Ordered
    * Indexed
    * Unordered

.. figure:: ordered_bag_example.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    An element being added to an ordered bag such that the order is preserved.


Nonlinear Data Structures
-------------------------

* Sometimes data has no natural linear ordering
* For example, in the below figures:

    * What comes after root in the filesystem example?
    * What comes after "Toronto" in the graph example?


Trees
^^^^^

* Like your file system
* Information is stored in a hierarchy

.. figure:: /topics/trees/tree_example.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    A simple file system on a computer.


Graphs
^^^^^^

* A way to represent relationships between *things*
* Like a road network, or flight routes

.. Figure:: graph_example.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    A hypothetical network of available flights between airports.


Abstract Data Types
-------------------

* These *collections* of data are sometimes called *Abstract Data Types* (ADTs)

    * ADTs because they are an *abstract* idea of how we want to interact with our data

        * What they do and how we interact with them

    * We do **not** talk about specific implementations and implementation issues

* A specific implementation of these ADTs is a *data structure*
* For example

    * The ``Stack`` ADT could be implemented with an array --- ``ArrayStack``
    * A ``Queue`` ADT could be implemented with a series of linked nodes --- ``LinkedQueue``



Java
====

* We are now going to switch programming languages to Java
* What about Python?

    * Don't worry, you'll quickly realize how similar Python and Java are
    * More than that, the important ideas are the same between the languages
    * There are some java-*isms* I will point out along the way
    * Python's flexibility often gets in the way when our programs grow in complexity

.. warning::

    Programming and Java are **not** a direct learning objective of this course. We are learning abstraction, data
    structures, and algorithms.


How do I go about programming Java!?
------------------------------------

* :doc:`Go here </getting-set/getting-set>`


Can we Write Code Now?
----------------------

* Below is an example of ``Hello, world!`` in Python and Java

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    # Python --- hello world
    print("Hello, world!")


.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    // Java --- hello world
    public class SomeClass {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        }
    }


* Other than the boilerplate code in the Java example, they're nearly the same

    * ``System.out.println("Hello, world!")`` is doing the job of ``print``
    * Mind the fact that our strings have double quotes (``"``) as single quotes is for a single character

        * ``"Hello"`` vs. ``'h'``

* What about:

    * ``public``
    * ``class``
    * ``static``
    * ``void``
    * ``main``
    * ``String[] args``
    * ``{`` ... ``}``


``public``

    * Visibility modifier
    * Remember adding underscores in Python to our attributes?
    * More on this later

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 4, 5, 6

    def __init__(self, firstName='John', lastName='Doe', stNum='000000000', curAvg=0):
        # The following attributes are "private"
        self._firstName = firstName
        self._lastName = lastName
        self._stNum = stNum
        self._curAvg = curAvg


``class``

    * This is the same idea as a Python class
    * Everything in Java needs to be within a class

``static``

    * Means that the function (or variable) belongs to the class, and not an instance of the class

        * We don't need to make an instance of the class to use the method

    * A good example of this in Java is the `Math class <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html>`_
    * More on this later, but here is an example of calling a method on a class vs. an instance of the class


.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 5

    // Calling a static function from the class "SomeClass"
    SomeClass.someStaticFunction();

    // Creating an instance of SomeClass and calling a method
    SomeClass anInstance = new SomeClass();
    anInstance.someMethod();

``void``

    * This is the return type of the function
    * Like Python, all values have a *type* in Java

        * Variables
        * Return types

    * Unlike Python, we must be explicit about our types in Java
    * In this case, the function returns nothing, so the type is ``void``


``main``

    * A **very very very** special function
    * The ``main`` function is the function that is called when we tell our computer to run our programs
    * Line 1 of the ``main`` function is the first line run by the program


``String[] args``

    * This defines a variable called ``args`` that is an array (indicated by the ``[]``) of ``Strings``

        * Remember, all values need a type

    * This is how we give our programs command line arguments

        * Basically parameters for our whole program

    * More on this later --- not overly important right now


``{`` ... ``}``

    * In Java we don't use indentation to define scope, we use open and close squiggly braces
    * You will quickly realize how great this is when compared to whitespace/indentation
