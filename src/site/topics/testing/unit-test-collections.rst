Unit Testing Collections
************************

* There has been an emphasis on writing code defensively
* Ideally, code is written in such a way that is, not only correct, but easy to test, understand, and reason about
* For example:

    * Immutability --- If the data cannot change, it makes the program more predictable
    * Avoiding side effects --- Functions/methods do not modify anything
    * Functions operate independently --- Self contained functionality is easier to understand and use


* However, collections pose a problem

    * Mutable --- their states change constantly through adding and removing data
    * Side effects --- their methods may have side effects (modifying the contents of the collection)
    * Interconnected methods --- Adding and removing data from a collection are inextricably connected
