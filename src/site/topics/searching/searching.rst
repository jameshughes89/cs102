Searching
*********

* For the purposes of this topic, searching is the process of looking for a specified *thing* in *some collection* to know if it exists within the collection
* For example, does a given number exist within an array of numbers?

* To write an algorithm to solve this problem, all that's needed is something that says if it's there or not

    * That's all that's required
    * Any algorithm that works would suffice


* However, the focus here will be on two intuitive ideas that people commonly use in one way or another throughout their lives

    * Linear Search
    * Interpolation Search

        * A specific kind of interpolation search called a *binary search* will be discussed


* Throughout this topic

    * The thing being searched for will be referred to as the ``needle``
    * The collection being searched through will be referred to as the ``haystack``



Linear Search
=============

* Start at the beginning of the ``haystack`` and sequentially look at each element until the ``needle`` is found

    * If the ``needle`` is found, then conclude that it is there
    * If the end of the ``haystack`` is reached without finding the ``needle``, then conclude that it is not there


* Notice that this description of the algorithm doesn't go into any more details

    * It is fairly high-level --- abstract


* The computational complexity of this algorithm is linear --- :math:`O(n)`

    * Worst case scenario, every element in the ``haystack`` was looked at before making any conclusion --- linear :math:`O(n)`
    * Best case scenario, the ``needle`` is the first element in the ``haystack`` --- constant :math:`O(1)`

    * On average, the element will be in the middle --- linear :math:`O(n)`

        * For every time ``needle`` is the first element, it could be the last element in another search
        * For every time the ``needle`` is the second element, it could be in the second last position in another search
        * ...

    Example linear collection of data. With a linear search, to guarantee if some ``needle`` exists within this
    ``haystack``, each element must be looked at.



Iterative
---------

* Below is a generic implementation of a linear search on an array of type ``T``

.. literalinclude:: /../main/java/SearchingFunctions.java
    :language: java
    :lineno-match:
    :lines: 7-14


* This iterative implementation is fairly similar to the high-level description of the algorithm

    * Start at ``i = 0`` --- the beginning of the ``haystack``
    * If the element at index ``i`` is the ``needle``, conclude that it's there
    * Otherwise continue and increment ``i``
    * If the end of the ``haystack`` is reached without finding the ``needle``, then conclude that it is not there



Recursive
---------

* Below is a recursive implementation of a linear search following the same high-level abstract idea

.. literalinclude:: /../main/java/SearchingFunctions.java
    :language: java
    :lineno-match:
    :lines: 16-24


* If I wanted to call this method, I would start with ``currentIndex`` as ``0``

    * ``recursiveLinearSearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0)``


* This may seem quite different from the iterative implementation, but the high-level idea is the same

    * Start ``currentIndex`` at ``0``
    * If the end of the ``haystack`` is reached without finding the ``needle``, then conclude that it is not there
    * If the element at index ``currentIndex`` is the ``needle``, conclude that it's there
    * Otherwise continue by calling the recursive function again with ``currentIndex`` incremented


Binary Search
=============

* Let's say you're looking for page 554 in a textbook
* You'd probably open the book somewhere in the middle-ish
* If the page you end up turning to is page 383, which half of the book should you continue your search on?
    * Left pages, or right pages?
* Since 554 is greater than 383, it must be in the set of right pages
    * We eliminate the 383 pages from the set of left pages from our search since 554 must **not** be there
* Next, you turn to a page somewhere between pages 383 and the end of the book and see page number 621
    * Which set of pages do you then continue your search down?

* This general idea is the basis of binary search
    * Technically, this is `interpolation search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation_search>`_, but binary search is a special kind of interpolation search

* There is, however, a catch with binary search when compared to a linear search
    * The haystack we're searching, must be sorted, otherwise we would not be able to conclude which half our needle is

* The complexity analysis of binary search may feel intimidating, but the trick is to not overthink it and take your time

.. image:: binary_search.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* When considering *linear search*, if we were looking for the number ``11.5``
* There are a total of ``15`` things in the haystack, so we would need to exhaustively look at all ``15`` of them
    * Here, ``15`` is :math:`n`

* When considering *binary search*, how many things would we need to look at if we wanted to know if ``11.5`` is there or not?
    * ``4``

* We get away with looking at fewer things because we are ignoring half the remaining elements every time we continue our search
    * ``11.5`` is greater than ``8``, therefore we can ignore all the elements on the left side

* Any idea what the relationship between the maximum number of checks and the number of elements in our haystack :math:`n`?
    * :math:`n = 2^{h + 1} - 1`, where `h` is the "height" of the tree, or, the number of steps needed to go from the top to the bottom
    * :math:`h = log_{2}(n + 1) - 1`

* Thus, the computational complexity of binary search is :math:`O(log_{2}(n))` since, as :math:`n` grows, the maximum number of steps we would need to take only grows like :math:`log_{2}(n)`

.. warning::

    We've gotten ahead of ourselves; the above explanation uses details we have not discussed yet, but will cover in the
    following topics. In other words, don't be too concerned if you are left scratching your head.


Iterative
---------

* Below is a generic implementation of an iterative binary search on an array of type ``T``
    * Take note that ``T`` or one of their superclasses must extend ``Comparable``
    * This is because the elements must be ordered

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int iterativeBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        int lowIndex = 0;
        int highIndex = haystack.length;
        int midpoint = (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;

        while (lowIndex < highIndex) {
            if (haystack[midpoint].equals(needle)) {
                return midpoint;
            } else if (haystack[midpoint].compareTo(needle) > 0) {
                highIndex = midpoint - 1;
                midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
            } else {
                lowIndex = midpoint + 1;
                midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

* This may look complicated, but again, take your time

* Here is what's happening
    * While we have not exhausted the search space (``lowIndex < highIndex``)
        * If ``lowIndex`` is ever greater than or equal to ``highIndex``, there are no more indices the element *could* exist
    * Look at the middle
    * If what you are looking at is what you're looking for
        * Done
    * If what you are looking at is less than what you're looking for
        * Continue the search on the remaining upper half by looking at the midpoint of the remaining elements
    * If what you are looking at is greater than than what you're looking for
        * Continue the search on the remaining lower half by looking at the midpoint of the remaining elements


Recursive
---------

* Below is a recursive implementation of a binary search
* Notice that, other than being recursive, the underlying high-level algorithm is the same as the iterative implementation

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int recursiveBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack, int lowIndex, int highIndex) {
        if (lowIndex >= highIndex) {
            return -1;
        }
        int midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
        if (haystack[midpoint].equals(needle)) {
            return midpoint;
        } else if (haystack[midpoint].compareTo(needle) > 0) {
            return recursiveBinarySearch(needle, haystack, lowIndex, midpoint - 1);
        } else {
            return recursiveBinarySearch(needle, haystack, midpoint + 1, highIndex);
        }
    }

* If I wanted to call this method, I would start with ``lowIndex`` as ``0`` and ``highIndex`` as ``someHaystack.length``
    * ``recursiveBinarySearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0, someHaystack.length)``

* Again, a helper method for the initial call would look something like this

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int recursiveBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        return recursiveBinarySearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0, someHaystack.length);
    }
