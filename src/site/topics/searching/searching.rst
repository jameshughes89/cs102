Searching
*********

* For our needs, we will say we want to search for a specified *thing* in *something* and know if it exists there or not
* For example, does a given number exist within an array of numbers
    * We will use this version of the problem here

* If we want to write an algorithm to solve this problem, all we really need is something that tells us if it's there or not
    * That's all that's required
    * We could write any algorithm that works

* However, we're going to look at two intuitive ideas that all of you have, more or less, used in one way or another many times in your life
    * Linear Search
    * Interpolation Search
        * We will discuss a specific kind of interpolation search called a *binary search*

* Throughout this topic, the thing we're looking for will be referred to as the *needle* and the collection we're searching will be referred to as the *haystack*


Linear Search
=============

* We have used linear search many times already
* Start at the beginning of an array and sequentially look at each element until we find a matching element
    * If we find it, then we conclude that it is there
    * If we get to the end and do not find it, then we conclude that it is not there

* Notice that this description of the algorithm doesn't really go into any more details
    * It is fairly high-level --- abstract

* We've also discussed the computational complexity
    * Worst case scenario, we look at every element in the array before we make a conclusion --- linear :math:`O(n)`
    * Best case scenario, the thing we are looking for is the first element --- constant :math:`O(1)`
    * On average, the element will be in the middle --- linear :math:`O(n)` --- remember, we ignore non-dominant terms, and :math:`1/2` is a constant, which is dominated by a linear term
        * For every time it's the first element, it could be the last element in another search
        * For every time it's the 2nd element, it could be in the second last position in another search
        * ...

* In the above example, to know if something is or is not there, we would need to look at all :math:`n` elements


Iterative
---------

* Below is a generic implementation of a linear search on an array of type ``T``
* Other than being a generic method, this should be something you are familiar with

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T> int iterativeLinearSearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        for (int i = 0; i < haystack.length; ++i) {
            if (haystack[i].equals(needle)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

* This iterative implementation is also fairly similar to the high-level description of the algorithm
    * Start at ``i = 0`` --- the beginning of the array
    * If the element at index ``i`` is what we're looking for, we've found it and we're done
    * Otherwise continue and increment ``i``
    * If we ever look at all indices and do not find it, then we conclude that it's not there and we're done


Recursive
---------

* Now that we are more familiar with recursion, here is the same high-level abstract idea, but implemented with recursion

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T> int recursiveLinearSearch(T needle, T[] haystack, int currentIndex) {
        // Not Found
        if (currentIndex == haystack.length) {
            return -1;
        } else if (haystack[currentIndex].equals(needle)) {
            return currentIndex;
        } else {
            return recursiveLinearSearch(needle, haystack, currentIndex + 1);
        }
    }

* If I wanted to call this method, I would start with ``currentIndex`` as ``0``
    * ``recursiveLinearSearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0)``

* It is also common to have a *helper* method that makes the first recursive call with the proper values

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T> int recursiveLinearSearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        return recursiveLinearSearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0);
    }


* This may seem quite different from the iterative implementation, but take some time to look at the code and see what's happening
    * Start ``currentIndex`` at ``0``
    * Are we past the end of the array? If so, we conclude we didn't find it and we're done
    * If the element at index ``currentIndex`` is what we're looking for, we've found it and we're done
    * Otherwise, if we're not at the end and we didn't find it, check ``currentIndex + 1``


Binary Search
=============

* Let's say you're looking for page 554 in a textbook
* You'd probably open the book somewhere in the middle-ish
* If the page you end up turning to is page 383, which half of the book should you continue your search on?
    * Left pages, or right pages?
* Since 554 is greater than 383, it must be in the set of right pages
    * We eliminate the 383 pages from the set of left pages from our search since 554 must **not** be there
* Next, you turn to a page somewhere between pages 383 and the end of the book and see page number 621
    * Which set of pages do you then continue your search down?

* This general idea is the basis of binary search
    * Technically, this is `interpolation search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation_search>`_, but binary search is a special kind of interpolation search

* There is, however, a catch with binary search when compared to a linear search
    * The haystack we're searching, must be sorted, otherwise we would not be able to conclude which half our needle is

* The complexity analysis of binary search may feel intimidating, but the trick is to not overthink it and take your time

.. image:: binary_search.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* When considering *linear search*, if we were looking for the number ``11.5``
* There are a total of ``15`` things in the haystack, so we would need to exhaustively look at all ``15`` of them
    * Here, ``15`` is :math:`n`

* When considering *binary search*, how many things would we need to look at if we wanted to know if ``11.5`` is there or not?
    * ``4``

* We get away with looking at fewer things because we are ignoring half the remaining elements every time we continue our search
    * ``11.5`` is greater than ``8``, therefore we can ignore all the elements on the left side

* Any idea what the relationship between the maximum number of checks and the number of elements in our haystack :math:`n`?
    * :math:`n = 2^{h + 1} - 1`, where `h` is the "height" of the tree, or, the number of steps needed to go from the top to the bottom
    * :math:`h = log_{2}(n + 1) - 1`

* Thus, the computational complexity of binary search is :math:`O(log_{2}(n))` since, as :math:`n` grows, the maximum number of steps we would need to take only grows like :math:`log_{2}(n)`

.. warning::

    We've gotten ahead of ourselves; the above explanation uses details we have not discussed yet, but will cover in the
    following topics. In other words, don't be too concerned if you are left scratching your head.


Iterative
---------

* Below is a generic implementation of an iterative binary search on an array of type ``T``
    * Take note that ``T`` or one of their superclasses must extend ``Comparable``
    * This is because the elements must be ordered

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int iterativeBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        int lowIndex = 0;
        int highIndex = haystack.length;
        int midpoint = (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;

        while (lowIndex < highIndex) {
            if (haystack[midpoint].equals(needle)) {
                return midpoint;
            } else if (haystack[midpoint].compareTo(needle) > 0) {
                highIndex = midpoint - 1;
                midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
            } else {
                lowIndex = midpoint + 1;
                midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

* This may look complicated, but again, take your time

* Here is what's happening
    * While we have not exhausted the search space (``lowIndex < highIndex``)
        * If ``lowIndex`` is ever greater than or equal to ``highIndex``, there are no more indices the element *could* exist
    * Look at the middle
    * If what you are looking at is what you're looking for
        * Done
    * If what you are looking at is less than what you're looking for
        * Continue the search on the remaining upper half by looking at the midpoint of the remaining elements
    * If what you are looking at is greater than than what you're looking for
        * Continue the search on the remaining lower half by looking at the midpoint of the remaining elements


Recursive
---------

* Below is a recursive implementation of a binary search
* Notice that, other than being recursive, the underlying high-level algorithm is the same as the iterative implementation

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int recursiveBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack, int lowIndex, int highIndex) {
        if (lowIndex >= highIndex) {
            return -1;
        }
        int midpoint = lowIndex + (highIndex - lowIndex) / 2;
        if (haystack[midpoint].equals(needle)) {
            return midpoint;
        } else if (haystack[midpoint].compareTo(needle) > 0) {
            return recursiveBinarySearch(needle, haystack, lowIndex, midpoint - 1);
        } else {
            return recursiveBinarySearch(needle, haystack, midpoint + 1, highIndex);
        }
    }

* If I wanted to call this method, I would start with ``lowIndex`` as ``0`` and ``highIndex`` as ``someHaystack.length``
    * ``recursiveBinarySearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0, someHaystack.length)``

* Again, a helper method for the initial call would look something like this

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> int recursiveBinarySearch(T needle, T[] haystack) {
        return recursiveBinarySearch(someNeedle, someHaystack, 0, someHaystack.length);
    }
