Getting set up for CSCI 162

Java Development Kit --- Oracle or OpenJDK
==========================================

There is a good chance that you already have the *Java Runtime Environment* (JRE) on your computer, but in order to
write, compile, and run our Java Programs, we need a *Java Development Kit* (JDK). The one from Oracle can be used for
this course and can be obtained `here <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html>`_.

Alternatively, you may use `OpenJDK <https://openjdk.java.net/>`_ which is actually the reference implementation.

Wither way, make sure you are using JDK version 11 or higher.

Other JDKs
^^^^^^^^^^

There exist other distributions of JDks out there. Two cool ones are `Amazon's Corretto <https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/>`_
and `Microsoft's OpenJDK <https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk>`_. You don't need these, but I thought I would let you know they exist.

Integrated Development Environment
==================================

We will use the `IntelliJ IDE <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download>`_. We will use the community edition, but feel
free to use the educational one if you want.

If you really prefer another IDE, reach out to me to ask about using it. Chances are you will be fine, but to be safe,
run it by me first.


But, What's Official?
=====================

Officially:

* We are using the Oracle or OpenJDK
* We are using IntelliJ
* Everything must run on the lab computers
    * Or whatever are "lab computers" these days
