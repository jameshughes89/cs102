Topic #12 --- ArrayQueue
************************

Idea #1
=======

Idea #2
=======

* Use an array for the container
* Keep track of the ``front`` index
* Keep track of the ``rear`` index
* Size will conveniently be ``rear - front``

* All adding happens at the ``rear`` end
* Add the element to index ``rear``
* Increment ``rear``

* ``dequeue`` always happens at index ``front````
* Increment ``front``

Discussion
----------

* Will this implementation work?
    * Is it *correct*
* Will we ever need to call ``expandCapacity``?
* What is the computational complexity of this ``enqueue``?
* What is the computational complexity of this ``dequeue``?
* How often will we call ``expandCapacity`` relative to idea #1?
* What drawback do you see?


Idea #3
