Assignments
===========


Submission
----------

Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student's responsibility
to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the assignment
receiving a mark of zero.

You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment
descriptions. Similarity detection software to identify possible cheating cases will be used.


Due Dates
---------

The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications. No submissions will be taken
after the due date; there are no late submissions. No extensions will be given for assignments.


Marking
-------

Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors.

A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available
after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your
assignment). Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why
you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as
well as the original marker's grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process
is complete.

It is each student's responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or
inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded
assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials
until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.



Tests
=====

No cheating of any form is allowed. Tests and exams are closed book/laptop/notebook/etc. and calculators, cell phones
and/or similar devices are not permitted. The possession of unauthorized devices during tests and examinations
constitutes violation of academic integrity, as per section 3.8.2(b)(v) of the academic calendar. Further, anything that
a reasonable person would deem as cheating is not permitted and will be investigated fully as academic misconduct.

Test format will be in person; however, if necessary, the format *may* be changed to online. Students will be informed
of the change as soon as possible.


Statement on Electronic Devices
-------------------------------

Unless you have medical accommodations that require you to do so, or explicit permission from the instructor of the
course, you may not use electronic devices during any of the tests, midterms, examinations, or
other in-class evaluations, including, but not limited to: cellphones, smart phones, smart watches, smart glasses, audio
players or recorders of any sort, video cameras, video games, DVD players, televisions, laptop/notebook/netbook
computers, flashlights, or laser pointers.


Missed Tests
------------

There are no make-up tests. If a student does not write the midterm and obtains an approved accommodation, the weight of
the midterm will be shifted to the final exam.



Labs
====

The purpose of the weekly labs is to give students hands-on experience. Labs will have assigned work and will make use
of `Kattis <https://open.kattis.com/>`_.

Labs begin on the 1st week of class. Unless special permission is granted, you may only attend the lab session for which
you are registered.

At the end of each lab are a series of Kattis problems. Kattis is a website with programming competition style problems
where people can submit their solutions for automated evaluation. A select set of Kattis problems related to course
material are included at the end of each lab for students to work on. It is not necessary to complete all these problems
for each lab as they can be quite challenging.



Email Contact
=============

**Email etiquette** --- Emails should be addressed to Dr./Prof. Hughes.

I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email
address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may
wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address.

Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you
let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing
email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent.

Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding
lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should
check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX
account and include CSCI 162 in the subject line of the email. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during
office hours.



Office Hours
============

Office hours are provided to students to facilitate their success --- students are encouraged to come to office hours.

Students must understand that the professors and TAs are not there to provide them answers to problems, but to assist
students solving their problems.



Attendance
==========

Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Assistant Vice-President Academic
Affairs. See section 3.7 of the academic calendar for more details. You will be reported if you are repeatedly
delinquent in assignments or attendance at classes or laboratories.



Copyright Policy
================

The materials in CSCI 162 at StFX are the property of the instructor, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Online
posting or selling this material to third parties for distribution without permission is subject to Canadian Copyright
law and is strictly prohibited.

The course copyright policy will be aggressively enforced.



Class Recording Policy
======================

Students may not create audio and/or video recordings of classes. Students creating unauthorized recording of lectures
violate an instructor's intellectual property rights and the Canadian Copyright Act. Students violating this policy will
be subject to disciplinary actions.



Statement of Academic Offenses and Academic Integrity
=====================================================

Please ensure that you are aware of the policy on Academic Integrity. Details can be found
`here <https://www.stfx.ca/media/40111/download>`_.

Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.

It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.



Use of Plagiarism-Checking Software
-----------------------------------

All required papers/submissions may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for such
checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of
papers subsequently submitted to the system.


Use of Cheating-Analysis Software
---------------------------------

All submitted work may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual
coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating (MOSS).



Tutoring
========

The role of tutoring is to help students understand course material. Tutors should not write assignments or take-home
tests for the students who hire them.



Information about Requesting an Accommodation at StFX
=====================================================

If you have a different learning ability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the instructor during
the first week of the semester so that your accommodations may be provided in a timely manner. Centre for Accessible
Learning (CAL) provides assistance in determining and facilitating appropriate accommodations for students with verified
disabilities.


Tramble Center for Accessible Learning
--------------------------------------

The Tramble Center for Accessible Learning welcomes students with documented permanent disabilities and offers them a
student-centered program of support. Located in Room 108 of the Angus L MacDonald Library, new and returning students
meet with program staff to discuss options for support. Deadline for registering with the Center is two weeks prior to
the end of classes each semester and 3 Business Days’ notice is required for booking all accommodated tests and exams.

Academic Accommodation for Medical Illness
------------------------------------------

Those unable to attend class, submit an assignment, or write a test, should refer to sections 3.7 and 3.9 of the
academic calendar.



Scent Policy
============

For the benefit of the many students that have a scent sensitivity, my classroom is a no-scent zone; please respect this
policy.



Statement on Equitable Learning
===============================

Everyone learns more effectively in a respectful, safe and equitable learning environment, free from discrimination and
harassment. Instructors and students are invited to work together to create a classroom space --- both real and virtual
--- that fosters and promotes values of human dignity, equity, non-discrimination, and respect for diversity.

Please feel free to talk with your course instructor about your questions or concerns about equity in our classroom or
in the StFX community in general. Should students have additional questions, they are encouraged to talk to the
Chair/Coordinator of the Department/Program or the Human Rights and Equity Advisor, contact information can be found at
`Directory | St. Francis Xavier University (stfx.ca) <https://www.stfx.ca/directory-department/921?groupid=346>`_.



Preferred Pronouns
==================

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class
rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by
an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make
appropriate changes to my records. See policies at
`Policies | St. Francis Xavier University (stfx.ca) <https://www.stfx.ca/human-rights-equity/policies>`_.
