********************************************************************
Outline for Computer Science 162 --- Programming and Data Structures
********************************************************************



Winter 2022
===========

.. warning::
    This outline is written assuming in person lectures begin 2 weeks after the start of the semester. As of the time
    of writing, the first two weeks are scheduled to be online only. If circumstances change, this outline will be
    updated accordingly. The major changes that would occur are (a) online lectures, (b) online labs, (c) the removal
    of the midterm and having its portion of the final grade spread over the assignments, and (d) the format of the
    final exam.

    None of the above warning should suggest that it is expected that things will change.



Course Description
==================

Continuing from the material in CSCI 161, this course covers memory management and data abstraction via classes and
objects, and introduces the linear data structures lists, stacks, and queues. Structured programming is encouraged via
modular development. Credit will be granted for only one of CSCI 162 and INFO 256. Three credits and a two-hour lab.



Prerequisites
=============

CSCI 125 or 161 or ENGR 147.

Unless you have the prerequisites for this course or written special permission from your Dean to enroll in it, you
will be removed from this course and it will be deleted from your record. This decision may not be appealed. You will
receive no adjustment to your fees in the event that you are dropped from a course for failing to have the necessary
prerequisites.

Assignment Submission
=====================

Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student's
responsibility to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the
assignment receiving a mark of zero.

You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment
descriptions.

We reserve the right to use similarity detection software to detect possible cheating cases.



Assignment Due Dates
====================

The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications.

Assignments are due on the posted due date, but will be accepted with no penalty for up to a maximum of 7 days after the
posted date. Any submission past the 7 day period will not be accepted.

No extensions will be given for assignments for after the 7 day late period.


Assignment Marking
==================

Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors.

A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available
after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your
assignment.) Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why
you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as
well as the original marker's grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process
is complete.

It is each student's responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or
inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded
assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials
until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.



Tests
=====

* No cheating of any form is allowed
* Tests and exams are closed book/laptop/notebook/etc.
* Calculators will not be permitted
* Use of a cell phone is not permitted
* The possession of unauthorized devices during tests and examinations constitutes violation of academic integrity, as per section 3.8.2(b)(v) of the academic calendar
* Anything that a reasonable person would deem as cheating is not permitted



Labs
====

The purpose of the labs is to give students guided, hands-on experience with programming. It is expected that students
will come prepared to the labs by reading the lab instructions. Lab instructions will be available on the course website
in advance. Students coming to lab unprepared will be asked to leave.

* Labs begin the **first** week of class.
* Lab exercises must be completed for marks. Each completed lab is worth 1% of your final grade (to a maximum of 10%).
    * If less than 10 are given, the lab weights will be adjusted to make up 10% of the final grade.
* You must attend the lab session for which you are registered.
* It is your responsibility to ensure your attendance and exercise completion is recorded.
* Students must bring their student identification to all labs.
* There are no make-up labs, and students who are absent for a lab do not have the option of attending another lab.
    * students who encounter serious health or other personal difficulties are encouraged to contact the professor.



Email Contact
=============

As far as you are concerned, my name is Dr. Hughes or Professor Hughes.

I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email
address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may
wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address.

Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you
let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing
email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent.

Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding
lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should
check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX
account and include CSCI 162 in the subject line of the email. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during
office hours.



Attendance
==========

Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Associate Dean. See section 3.7 of the
academic calendar for more details.

You will be reported to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs' Office if you are repeatedly delinquent
in assignments or attendance at classes or laboratories.



Copyright Policy
================

The materials in CSCI 161 at StFX are the property of the instructor, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Online
posting or selling this material to third parties for distribution without permission is subject to Canadian Copyright
law and is strictly prohibited.

The course copyright policy will be aggressively enforced.


Class Recording Policy
======================

Students may not create audio and/or video recordings of classes. Students creating unauthorized recording of lectures
violate an instructor's intellectual property rights and the Canadian Copyright Act. Students violating this policy will
be subject to disciplinary actions.



Statement of Academic Offenses
===============================

Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.

It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.



Use of Plagiarism-Checking Software
===================================

All required papers/submissions may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for such
checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of
papers subsequently submitted to the system.



Use of Cheating-Analysis Software
=================================

All submitted work may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual
coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating (MOSS).



Tutoring
========

The role of tutoring is to help students understand course material. Tutors should not write assignments, etc. for the
students who hire them.

If you need help though, please just come by my office, or go see the TAs. We're here to help and most office hours are
criminally underused (unless there's an assignment due... then it looks like Main st. at 4:45pm).



Statement on Accommodation of Religious Observances
===================================================

Requests for accommodation of specific religious or spiritual observance must be presented in writing to the instructor
within the fist two weeks of class.



Statement for Students with Disabilities
========================================

Students who have a disability and who require academic accommodations must register with the Centre for Accessible
Learning as early as possible in order to receive accommodations. http://sites.stfx.ca/accessible_learning/

The Tramble Center for Accessible Learning welcomes students with documented permanent disabilities and offers them a
student-centered program of support. Located in Room 108 of the Angus L. MacDonald Library, new and returning students
meet with program staff to discuss options for support. Deadline for registering with the Center is two weeks prior to
the end of classes each semester and 3 Business Days' notice is required for booking all accommodated tests and exams.

To book an appointment please use the following:
* link --- http://stfxcal.mywconline.com
* Phone --- 902 867 5349
* Email --- tramble@stfx.ca



Academic Accommodation for Medical Illness
==========================================

Those unable to attend class, submit an assignment, or write a test, should refer to sections 3.7 and 3.9 of the
academic calendar.



Scent Policy
============

For the benefit of the many students that have a scent sensitivity, my classroom is a no-scent zone; please respect this
policy.



Equity
======

Everyone learns more effectively in a respectful, safe and equitable learning environment, free from discrimination and
harassment. We invite you to work with me to create a classroom space – both real and virtual – that fosters and
promotes values of human dignity, equity, non-discrimination and respect for diversity.

Please feel free to talk with us about your questions or concerns about equity in our classroom or in the STFX community
in general. If we cannot answer your questions or help you address your concerns, we encourage you to talk to the
Chair/Coordinator of the Department/Program or the Human Rights and Equity Advisor. Please note that a Human Rights and
Equity Advisor will soon be appointed. In the meantime, students, faculty, or staff may also contact the Director of
Human Resources at hr@stfx.ca or the Office of the AVP&P.
