 Online courses allow for some flexibility in how class time is integrated into your routine. Nevertheless, there is a
 well-structured and demanding workflow to which you are expected to adhere.

 This course is designed for a typical 12 week semester, but is being offered as an accelerated 8 week course. Students
 must be prepared for the pacing of the course.
