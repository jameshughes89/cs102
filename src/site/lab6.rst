* When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective


Making a Rudimentary Array Queue
================================

Despite not being a great implementation, we're going to build a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` that always keeps the front
of the queue at index ``0``. This is idea #1 from the :doc:`ArrayQueue topic</topic12>`.

1. Create a project and make a class where you will put your main method
    * Perhaps call it ``Lab6``

2. Download the :download:`Queue interface<../main/java/Queue.java>` and add it to your project

3. Create a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class

4. Complete the ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class by fully implementing the ``Queue`` interface
    * There will be a lot of overlap with the :download:`ArrayQueue<../main/java/ArrayQueue.java>` class

5. Download and modify the :download:`ArrayQueueTest<../test/java/ArrayQueueTest.java>` to create a `RudimentaryArrayQueueTest` to verify everything is working correctly
