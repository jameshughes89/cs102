Assignment #3: Maze Solver: Using Artificial Intelligence
*********************************************************

* **Worth**: 10%
* **DUE**: March 28th 11:55pm; submitted on MOODLE.


Task
====

Your goal is to solve a maze, again, but this time with artificial intelligence (AI). You will implement the A* (A-star)
algorithm, which in our case, is guaranteed to find an optimal solution.

You will:

* Write a ``LinkedPriorityQueue`` class that implements a ``PriorityQueue``
    * This data structure greatly helps with the implementation of A*
* Write a ``AStarMazeSolver`` class that implements the ``MazeSolver`` interface
    * Within this class, you will write the ``solve`` method.
* You will use the ``AStarMazeSolver``, along with some of the other provided classes, in the ``main`` to:
    * Create the maze
    * Solve the maze
    * Print out the solution
* You will also be testing your implementation with test classes

Some Hints
==========

* Work on one method at a time.
* Use the unit tests.
* Get each method *working perfectly* before you go on to the next one.
* *Test* each method as you write it.
    * This is a really nice thing about programming; you can call your methods and see what result gets returned. Does it seem correct?
    * Mentally test before you even write --- what does this method do? What problem is it solving?
* If you need help, **ask**! Drop by my office hours.


Some Marking Details
====================

.. warning::
    Just because your program produces the correct output, that does not necessarily mean that you will get perfect, or
    even that your program is correct.

Below is a list of both *quantitative* and *qualitative* things we will look for:

* Correctness?
* Did you follow instructions?
* Comments?
* Variable Names?
* Style?
* Did you do just weird things that make no sense?


What to Submit to Moodle
========================

Submit your work on Moodle.

* Your ``.java`` files. Please do not compress them.

* Make sure your **NAME** and **STUDENT NUMBER** appear in a comment at the top of the program.

**VERIFY THAT YOUR SUBMISSION TO MOODLE WORKED!**
**IF YOU SUBMIT INCORRECTLY, YOU WILL GET A 0**


FAQ:
====

* I don't know where to start.
    * Did you read the assignment description?

* I still don't know where to start.
    * Part 0.

* Should I be making any significant changes to the provided code/files?
    * Unless it's an empty class you are to complete, no.

* I know you told me to do it this way, but I did it another way, and I think my way is better.
    * Your way may be better, but do it the way I told you.

* I don't know how to do *X*.
    * OK, go to `google.ca <https://www.google.ca>`_ and type in *X*.

* You have asked us to do something you never taught us.
    * Good thing google exists and you're capable of learning learn on your own.
    * Jokes aside, reading docs and figuring out how to do stuff is a huge part of your job.

* Can I email you or the TA for help?
    * Absolutely, *buuuuut*
    * Tell me all the things you have tried before emailing. If it's a short list, I may ignore you.
    * Do not send me code, do not send me screenshots of code, do not try to describe chunks of code in english, etc.
    * Email is appropriate for quick clarification questions.
    * Anything beyond that should be addressed at office hours.
    * Please do not just send the email anyways to fish and see if I will answer --- I won't, and I'll be annoyed.

* I swear I did everything right, but my files are not opening.
    * This one isn't uncommon.
    * Your files may be in the wrong location on your computer.
    * I provided you with a constant for the relative path to the files, so that should work.

* It's not working, therefore Java is broken!
    * Probably not; you're likely doing something wrong.

* There is a bug in my code and it's not working
    * Welcome to writing code.
    * Keep at it, you'll get there.

* There is a bug in my code and it's not working after hours of debugging
    * This is normal.
    * Keep at it, you'll get there.
    * I believe in you.
    * You are a capable human being.

* Do I have enough comments?
    * I don't know, maybe?
    * If you're looking at code and have to ask if you should comment it... just comment it.
    * That said, don't write me a book.

* I know I cheated, I know I know I was cheating, but I'm reeeeaaaaaaaaallllllly sorry [that I got caught]. Can we just ignore it this time?
    * No.
    * Catching cheaters is one of my only joys in life.

* What's this whole *due date* and *cutoff date* business?
    * The due date is the due date, so hand things in before the due date, otherwise it is considered late.
    * But you may submit your late assignment with no penalty up to the cutoff date.
    * There are no extensions beyond the cutoff date.

* Can I have an extension?
    * You can have the 7 days before the cutoff period.
    * After the cutoff date though, no --- no extension.

* If I submit it at 11:56pm, you'll still mark it, right? I mean, commmmon!
    * No.
    * 11:55pm and earlier is on time.
    * Anything after 11:55pm is late.
    * Anything late is not marked.
    * It's rather simple really.

* Moodle was totally broken, it's not my fault it's late.
    * Nice try.
    * But to hedge, don't try to submit it at the last minute.

* I accidentally submitted the wrong code. Here is the right code, but it's late. But you can see that I submitted the wrong code on time! You'll still accept it, right?
    * Do you think I was born yesterday?
    * No.

* Will I really get 0 if I do the submission wrong? Like, what if I submit the .class instead of the .java?
    * Yes, you'll really get a **ZERO**.
    * Just double check to make sure your submission is correct.
