.. warning::

    We are not yet defining a new ADT. We're just prepping to start implementing other ADTs with something other than an array.


* Arrays have a fixed size
    * But we can change capacity

* When using an array, we may have to shift things around when adding and removing
* Traditionally speaking, arrays are in contiguous memory addresses
    * JVM asterisk --- In Java, arrays are objects, and objects go into the *heap*, which isn't necessarily contiguous.


Linked Structure
================

Nodes
=====

* A *node* is a basic unit in our linked structures
* Here we are focusing on *singly linked structures*
    * Each node has only one *link*

* The series of nodes linked together is what makes up the singly linked structure
    * They link to their successor

.. image:: img/node_example.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* A node for a singly linked structure typically has only two fields
    * **data** --- the stuff we want to hold
        * To compare to the array, this would be the stuff we're putting into the cells of the array
    * **next** --- a reference to the successor/next node
        * Arrays don't have this because the successor is just in the next index in the array
            * Asterisk


Inserting into a Linked Structure
=================================

* Given the example linked structure
* How would you access the *first* item's data?
* How would you access the *second* item's data?
* How would you access the *third* item's data?
* How would you access the predecessor?
* **HINT:** What are the fields we would have in our node object?

* How would we add something to the *front* of this linked structure?
* How would we add something to the *middle* of this linked structure?
* How would we add something to the *end* of this linked structure?

* How would we remove something to the *front* of this linked structure?
* How would we remove something to the *middle* of this linked structure?
* How would we remove something to the *end* of this linked structure?


Adding to the Front
-------------------

   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* Make the node we want to insert's next point to the current head

.. image:: img/links_addfront1.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* Make head, the reference to the start of the linked structure, point to the new node

Variations
==========

* For many of the stuff we're learning, there are variations
* You may be wondering: *Can we add references going more than one direction?*
    * Absolutely
