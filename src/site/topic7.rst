.. warning::

    We are not yet defining a new ADT. We're just prepping to start implementing other ADTs with something other than an array.


* Arrays have a fixed size
    * But we can change capacity

* When using an array, we may have to shift things around when adding and removing
* Traditionally speaking, arrays are in contiguous memory addresses
    * JVM asterisk --- In Java, arrays are objects, and objects go into the *heap*, which isn't necessarily contiguous.

Variations
==========

* For many of the stuff we're learning, there are variations
* You may be wondering: *Can we add references going more than one direction?*
    * Absolutely
