Iterative Definition vs. Recursive Definition
=============================================

* Iterative definitions of things are fairly natural for us
* Recursion on the other hand may *feel* a little less natural, but it pops up a lot in our lives and in nature
* Debugging can sometimes feel a little recursive
    * Ever been debugging to deal with bug ``a``
    * Then notice that to solve it, you need to fix ``b``
    * Then, to fix ``b``, you need to resolve ``c``
    * Once ``c`` is fixed, you can fix ``b``
    * Since ``b`` is fixed, you can finally finish ``a``


Groups of People
----------------

* Like the line of people example above, it may seem like a silly question because it is so intuitive

* A group of people is:
    * 2 people
    * OR 2 people
    * OR 3 people
    * OR 4 people
    * OR ...
    * ...
    * ...

* Alternatively, we can use the idea of recursion to define a group of people a different way
* When we use recursion to define something, we use the definition of itself in it's definition
    * Define something in terms of itself

* Recursive definition of a **group of people** is:
    * 2 people
    * OR a **group of people** plus one more person

* Based on this definition, if I ask you if 2 people are a **group of people**, the answer is clearly yes (the first point)
* But if I ask you if 4 people is a **group of people**, we need to do some digging
    * In order to tell you if 4 people is a **group of people**, I need to know if 3 people is a **group of people**
        * If 3 is, then I know 4 is since 4 is then be a **group of people** plus one more person
    * To know if 3 people is a **group of people**, I must know if 2 people is a **group of people**
    * I know, by definition, that 2 people is, in fact, a **group of people**
    * Therefore, I know that 3 people is a **group of people**
    * Thus, 4 people must be a **group of people**

* In the above recursive example, you will notice a **base case** and a **recursive** case
    * The base case is something with a clear definition
    * The recursive case is one that defines itself in terms of itself
