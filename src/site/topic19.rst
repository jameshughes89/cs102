Iterative Definition vs. Recursive Definition
=============================================

* Iterative definitions of things are fairly natural for us
* Recursion on the other hand may *feel* a little less natural, but it pops up a lot in our lives and in nature
* Debugging can sometimes feel a little recursive
    * Ever been debugging to deal with bug ``a``
    * Then notice that to solve it, you need to fix ``b``
    * Then, to fix ``b``, you need to resolve ``c``
    * Once ``c`` is fixed, you can fix ``b``
    * Since ``b`` is fixed, you can finally finish ``a``
