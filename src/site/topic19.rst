* How many people are in this line?
    * How would you count them?

* I'd say the answer is, just by looking at the first person, it's exactly ``1 + `` the number of people after the first person

Lists
-----

* Think of a list from Python, or a linear linked structure
* We can define this recursively in a rather natural way

* A list is:
    * **Base Case** --- an empty list
    * **Recursive Case** --- There is a head of the list, followed by a tail that's a list

* Consider the following list

    ``[a, b, c, d, e]``

* This can be broken down into the head ``a`` and the tail ``[b, c, d, e]``

    ``a + [b, c, d, e]``

* Further, we can break the tail list down again and again and again until we hit an empty list

    `` a + b + [c, d, e]``
    `` a + b + c + [d, e]``
    `` a + b + c + d + [e]``
    `` a + b + c + d + e + []``
