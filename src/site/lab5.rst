Making a Linked Structure
==========================

Start by building a linked structure. The idea is to simply have a series of ``Node`` objects.

Node Class
----------

1. Create a project and make a class where you will put your main method
    * Perhaps call it ``Lab5``

2. Create a generic ``Node`` class
    * Feel free to :download:`download this one <../main/java/Node.java>`
        * If you do though, be sure to understand it and don't just copy/paste

3. Do a simple test to see if it works by making an instance in your main method and using the node's methods

    .. code-block:: java
        :linenos:

        Node<Integer> myNode = new Node<>(5);
        // Use the node class' methods here


Create the Linked Structure
---------------------------

1. Write a static method in the same class as your main called ``makeLinkedStructure`` that will
    * Create a linked structure 

Manipulating the Linked Structure
