Unit Testing
============

We're going to write tests for our ``CourseList`` class from `:doc: Lab2 </lab2>`. :doc:`Topic 6's aside on testing will be of great help here </topic6-testing>`.


Have a Working Implementation
-----------------------------

1. If you have not already, finish `:doc: Lab2 </lab2>`


Writing Tests
-------------

**Tips**
* Make your test method names as descriptive as possible while still being brief
* Follow some convention for your method names, something like ``methodConditionExpected()``
    * ``sizeOfEmptyCourseListReturnsZero()``
    * ``addingBeyondCapacityCallsExpandCapacityToMakeRoomForAdd()``


1. Create your testing class for ``CourseList`` called ``CourseListTest``

2. Write unit tests to test the ``size()`` method
    * empty list has size zero?
    * non empty list has proper size?
    * list that has been emptied via removes has size zero?

3. Write tests for ``add``
    * Is the added element added?
    * Can we add beyond a capacity limit?

4. Write tests for ``remove``
    * Does the element get removed?
    * What happens if we try to remove something that doesn't exist?
    * What happens when we call remove once for something that exists more than once in the ``CourseList``?

5. Write tests for ``get``
    * Does it return the element from the correct index?
    * What happens if you try to get something from beyond the range?
    * What happens if you try to get something from a negative index?


6. Write tests for ``indexOf``
    * Try to figure out which tests you should have on your own/with a friend

7. Write tests for the ``Course`` class
    * Try to figure out which tests you should have on your own/with a friend
