Throwing an Exception
=====================

Catching Exceptions
===================

* If someone is using our ``LinkedStack`` for their code 2 years from now, I can't know what they should do to manage peeking from an empty stack
* The users of our class will need to deal with this how they want

* Maybe this doesn't matter to them and they don't even try to catch the exception
    * If the exception is thrown, their program will crash, but this doesn't matter to them

* Maybe they need to stop the execution of the code immediately
    * They are running medical equipment that delivers radiation therapy




For next time
=============

* Go back and read Chapter 3 Section 5
