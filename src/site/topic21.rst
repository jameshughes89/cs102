Topic #21 --- Trees
*******************

* Trees are *nonlinear* data structures
    * An easy way to think of this is, there is no obvious natural ordering

* Data can be organised in some hierarchical way
    * Family trees
    * Inheritance
    * File systems on a computer
    * Decision trees
    * Table of contents of a book

Definitions & Terminology
=========================

Tree Definition
---------------

* A **tree** is a collection of elements such that:
    * It is empty
    * Or, it has a special element called the *root*, from which descends zero or more trees (subtrees)

* Notice that this definition is recursive

Measuring
---------

* A **path** is the sequence of nodes and edges leading from one node to another

* The **path length** is the number of *edges* in the path

* The **height** of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node
