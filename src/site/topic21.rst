*******************

* Trees are *nonlinear* data structures
    * An easy way to think of this is, there is no obvious natural ordering

* Data can be organised in some hierarchical way
    * Family trees
    * Inheritance
    * File systems on a computer
    * Decision trees
    * Table of contents of a book
