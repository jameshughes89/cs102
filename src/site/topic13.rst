Sorted Bags
-----------

* If we want a specific kind of bag that keeps our elements sorted based on some ordering, adding will need to be done carefully
    * Unlike the general bag, this specific kind of bag will have an ordering

* The ordering of the elements will depend on some characteristic of the contents of the bag
    * Numbers in ascending order
    * Strings in alphabetical order

* The elements themselves are what determine the ordering

* There really is only one way to add elements to this sorted bag
    * The elements **must** go where it belongs
* We cannot specify where we add it because that may break our sorted ordering

* Should there be rules restricting removing from the bag?
