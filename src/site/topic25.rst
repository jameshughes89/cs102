Topic #25 --- Sorting
*********************

* Like searching, sorting is a classic problem that we take for granted
* We have all sorted things before
* We all know what it *means*
* We all know what a correct outcome is
* But, chances are, you have not spent a lot of time really analyzing *how* you have sorted things

* Perhaps even more interesting, until relatively recently, we've been pretty terrible at it
    * And chances are, you are too
