Topic #25 --- Sorting
*********************

* Like searching, sorting is a classic problem that we take for granted
* We have all sorted things before
* We know what it *means*
* We know what a correct outcome is
* But, chances are, you have not spent a lot of time really analyzing *how* you have sorted things

* Perhaps even more interesting, until relatively recently, we've been pretty terrible at it
    * And chances are, you are too

* There are many sorting algorithms out there
* They will work different ways, but result in sorted collections
* Some will more or less be the same in terms of the amount of computation required
* And some will be much better than others

* `Here is a simple visualization of some popular sorting algorithms <https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms>`_
