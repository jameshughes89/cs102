Topic #25 --- Sorting
*********************

* Like searching, sorting is a classic problem that we take for granted
* We have all sorted things before
* We know what it *means*
* We know what a correct outcome is
* But, chances are, you have not spent a lot of time really analyzing *how* you have sorted things

* Perhaps even more interesting, until relatively recently, we've been pretty terrible at it
    * And chances are, you are too

* There are many sorting algorithms out there
* They will work different ways, but result in sorted collections
* Some will more or less be the same in terms of the amount of computation required
* And some will be much better than others

* `Here is a simple visualization of some popular sorting algorithms <https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms>`_


Sorting Problem
===============

* Given a collection of *things*
    * Numbers
    * Strings
    * People
    * Car Parts

* The goal is to arrange the collection of *things* such that they are *in order*


Order
-----

* What *in order* means however will depend on what is being sorted
* For example
    * Numbers come with an intrinsic ordering
    * Strings could be ordered alphabetically
        * Perhaps by length?
        * Maybe based on the character's ascii values?
        * Treat the strings as base 26 integers?
    * Sort people based on height
        * Or age?
        * Or month and day of birthday?
    * Car Parts by mass?
        * Or production code?
        * Date they were made?
        * Volume?
        * The amount of dust particles on the surface?

* With numbers, we don't feel the need to ask
* But with other things, we need to have a well defined ordering for the *things*
    * The things themselves have the order-*ness* property, not a sorting algorithm
