Lab #1
******

* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab
* I will not be helping people setup IntelliJ on their laptops
* Ensure I have recorded your completion. Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

Creating a Project
==================

1. Open IntelliJ
2. Create a new project
    * You may see a start page
    * Or you may need to go *File -> New -> Project*
    * Don't use the templates
    * You should see something like this

    .. image:: img/lab1_empty.png
       :width: 500 px
       :align: center

3. Add a Java class to the project
    * Right click *src* in the project explorer
    * *New -> Java Class*
    * Give your class a name, something like *Lab1*
        * **Always start your class names with an uppercase letter**

4. Add a ``main`` method to your class and have it do ``Hello, world!``

    .. code-block:: java
        :linenos:

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        }

5. Run your program
    * *Run -> Run*
    * You may have to select the class you want to run

       :width: 500 px
       :align: center



**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**
