Playing with Objects
====================

We will make a program that will keep track of a collection of courses offered. To do this we will write two classes ---
one for keeping track of the information about a single course, and another for keeping track of multiple courses.


Course Class
------------

A ``Course`` is a simple object that keeps track of data for us.

#. Create a class called ``Course`` that has three private fields: ``programCode``, ``courseCode``, and ``courseTitle``.

    * For example, this course would have the following values for the fields

        * ``programCode`` --- ``"CSCI"``
        * ``courseCode`` --- ``"162"``
        * ``courseTitle`` --- ``"Programming and Data Structures"``

#. Write a single constructor to take and assign values to the fields.

#. Write getters and setters for each field.

#. Write a ``toString`` method that returns ``programCode``, followed by a space, followed by the ``courseCode``.

    * For example, ``"CSCI 162"``

#. Write ``equals`` that checks if two ``Course`` objects are equivalent.

    * We will say that two courses are equal if their ``programCode`` and ``courseCode`` are equal
    * Remember to be careful with ``==``

#. Test the ``Course`` class by making a instances of them and calling the methods to see if they work as you expect.


Course List Class
-----------------

A ``CourseList`` will be a collection of ``Course`` objects that we can add and remove from.

#. Make a ``CourseList`` class that has two private fields (``list`` & ``size``) and a constant for a default capacity.

    * ``list`` will be an array that holds references to ``Course`` objects
    * ``size`` will be the number of ``Courses`` currently in ``list``

        * Remember, the capacity of the array and ``size`` are not the same thing

    * ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY`` is a constant that will be used for creating the ``list`` array if no capacity is provided

#. Write two constructors.

    * One that takes no parameter and makes ``list`` based on ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY``
    * The other takes a parameter ``initialCapacity`` for the capacity of ``list``
    * Try to use *constructor chaining*

#. Write an ``add`` method that takes a ``Course`` object and adds it to the collection.

    * You will need to also make a private ``expandCapacity`` method for ``add`` to work properly

#. Write a ``remove`` method that takes a ``Course`` to find and remove a ``Course`` from the collection.

    * Make use of the ``Course`` object's ``equals`` method

#. Write a ``get`` method that returns the ``Course`` object from the specified index in the ``CourseList``.

#. Write a ``indexOf`` method that returns the index of a specified ``Course`` object.

#. Write a ``size`` method to return the number of ``Course`` objects in the collection.

#. Write a reasonable ``toString`` for the class.

#. Test the ``CourseList`` class by calling the methods.
