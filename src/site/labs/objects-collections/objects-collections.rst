Creating Objects
================

The goal is to make a program that will keep track of a suite of courses. To do this, two classes will be written ---
one for keeping track of the information about a single course, and another for keeping track of multiple courses.


Course Class
------------

A ``Course`` is a simple object to keeps track of data.
:doc:`Refer to the objects review topic </topics/objects-review/objects-review>` for guidance on creating this class.


#. Create a class called ``Course`` that has three private fields: ``programCode``, ``courseCode``, and ``courseTitle``

    * For example, this course would have the following values for the fields

        * ``programCode`` --- ``"CSCI"``
        * ``courseCode`` --- ``"162"``
        * ``courseTitle`` --- ``"Programming and Data Structures"``


#. Write a single constructor to take and assign values to the fields
#. Write accessors methods for the three fields

    * For example, ``getCourseCode``


#. Write a ``toString`` method that returns a string representation of the object

    * The string should be of the form ``"Course(programCode, courseCode, courseTitle)"``


#. Write an ``equals`` method that checks if two ``Course`` objects are equivalent

    * Two ``Course`` objects are considered equal if all their fields match
    * Remember, do not check string equality with ``==``


#. Write a ``hashCode`` method
#. Test the ``Course`` class by making instances of them and calling the methods to see if they as expected



Course List Class
-----------------

A ``CourseList`` will be a collection of ``Course`` objects.
:doc:`Refer to the data structures review topic </topics/objects-review/data-structures-review>` for guidance on
creating this class. It is recommended to go through the topic and refactor the relevant code to fit the requirements of
this lab. 


#. Make a ``CourseList`` class that has two private fields (``list`` & ``size``) and a constant for a default capacity

    * ``list`` will be an array that holds references to ``Course`` objects
    * ``size`` will be the number of ``Course`` objects currently in ``list``

        * Remember, the capacity of the array and ``size`` are not the same thing

    * ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY`` is a constant that will be used for creating the ``list`` array if no capacity is provided


#. Write two constructors

    * One takes no parameter and makes ``list`` based on ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY``
    * The other takes a parameter ``initialCapacity`` for the starting capacity of ``list``
    * :doc:`Try to use constructor chaining </topics/objects-review/chaining>`


#. Write an ``add`` method that takes a ``Course`` object and adds it to the collection

    * This will require a mechanism to "expand the capacity" of the array  to work properly


#. Write a ``contains`` method that takes a ``Course`` as a parameter and returns ``true`` if it exists in the collection and ``false`` otherwise
#. Write a ``indexOf`` method that returns the index of a specified ``Course`` object

    * If no such ``Course``  exists, this method should throw an exception


#. Write a ``remove`` method that takes a ``Course`` to remove from the collection as a parameter

    * If no such ``Course``  exists, this method should throw an exception
    * Make use of the ``Course`` object's ``equals`` method


#. Write a ``get`` method that returns the ``Course`` object at the specified index in the ``CourseList``

    * If the provided index is out of bounds, this method should throw an exception


#. Write a ``size`` method to return the number of ``Course`` objects in the collection
#. Write a ``toString`` for the class
#. Test the ``CourseList`` class by creating an instance of it and using the methods
