Making a Rudimentary Array Queue
================================

Despite not being a great implementation, the goal is to build a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` that always keeps the front
of the queue at index ``0``. This is idea #1 from the :doc:`ArrayQueue topic</topics/queues/array-queue>`.

#. Download the :download:`Queue interface<../../../main/java/Queue.java>` and add it to the project
#. Create a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class
#. Complete the ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class by fully implementing the ``Queue`` interface

    * There will be a lot of overlap with the :download:`ArrayQueue<../../../main/java/ArrayQueue.java>` class
    * Consider creating a private helper method for moving elements down the array after a ``dequeue``


#. Create a ``RudimentaryArrayQueueTest`` class to test the ``RudimentaryArrayQueue``

    * Make use of the existing :download:`ArrayQueueTest<../../../test/java/ArrayQueueTest.java>` class as a reference
