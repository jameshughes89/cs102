Queues

* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* Ensure I have recorded your completion --- failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab

    * When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective


Making a Rudimentary Array Queue
================================

Despite not being a great implementation, we're going to build a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` that always keeps the front
of the queue at index ``0``. This is idea #1 from the :doc:`ArrayQueue topic</topics/queues/array-queue>`.

1. Create a project and make a class where you will put your main method
    * Perhaps call it ``Lab6``

2. Download the :download:`Queue interface<../../../main/java/Queue.java>` and add it to your project

3. Create a ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class

4. Complete the ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` class by fully implementing the ``Queue`` interface
    * There will be a lot of overlap with the :download:`ArrayQueue<../../../main/java/ArrayQueue.java>` class
    * You will need a way to move the elements down the array after a ``dequeue`` to remove the gap at index ``0`` --- perhaps a private method

5. Download and modify the :download:`ArrayQueueTest<../../../test/java/ArrayQueueTest.java>` to create a `RudimentaryArrayQueueTest` to verify everything is working correctly
    * Remember, even though we have a linear time ``dequeue`` and we saw an improved implementation, the ``RudimentaryArrayQueue`` is still, by definition, a queue
