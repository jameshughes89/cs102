************************************************
Assignment #1: Playing with Objects is Still Fun
************************************************

* **Worth**: 10%
* **DUE**: TBD at 11:55pm; submitted on MOODLE.




What to submit to Moodle
========================

Submit your work on Moodle.

* Your ``.java`` files.

* Make sure your **NAME** and **STUDENT NUMBER** appear in a comment at the top of the program.


**VERIFY THAT YOUR SUBMISSION TO MOODLE WORKED!**
**IF YOU SUBMIT INCORRECTLY, YOU WILL GET A 0**


Some hints
==========

* Work on one method at a time.
* Get each method *working perfectly* before you go on to the next one.
* *Test* each method as you write it.
    * This is a really nice thing about programming; you can call your methods and see what result gets returned. Does it seem correct?
    * Mentally test before you even write --- what does this method do? What problem is it solving?
* If you need help, **ask**! Drop by my office hours.

Some marking details
====================
.. warning::
    Just because your program produces the correct output, that does not necessarily mean that you will get perfect, or even that your program is correct.

Below is a list of both *quantitative* and *qualitative* things we will look for:

* Correctness?
* Did you follow instructions?
* Comments?
* Variable Names?
* Style?
* Did you do just weird things that make no sense?


FAQ:
====
* Does my text file have enough details?
    * Probably. The shorter the better.
* I don't know how to do *X*.
    * OK, go to `google.ca <https://www.google.ca>`_ and type in *X*.
* It’s not working, therefore Java is broken!
    * Probably not; you’re very likely doing something wrong

* Wtf do the methods do that you gave me?
    * Read the descriptions. Try figuring it out. This is actually part of the assignment learning objectives.

* Do I have enough comments?
    * I don't know, maybe? If you're looking at code and have to ask if you should comment it... just comment it. That said, don't write me a book.
* I know you told me to do it this way, but I did it another way, and I think my way is better.
    * Your way may be better, but I don’t care. Do it the way I told you.

* If our code/methods are identical, you won't really call this cheating, would you? I mean, you said we could work together!
    * I will absolutely try to nail you for cheating. I am letting you work together. Don't push it. All-in-all, it's going to be hard to *cheat* unless you are deliberately trying to.
* I know I cheated, I know I know I was cheating, but I’m reeeeaaaaaaaaallllllly sorry [that I got caught]. Can we just ignore it this time?
    * Lol, no
* If I submit it at 11:56pm, you’ll still mark it, right? I mean, commmmon!
    * No. 11:55pm and earlier is on time. Anything after 11:55pm is late. Anything late is not marked. It’s rather simple really.
* Moodle was totally broken, it’s not my fault it’s late.
    * Nice try.
* I accidentally submitted the wrong code. Here is the right code, but it’s late. But you can see that I submitted the wrong code on time! You’ll still accept it, right?
    * Do you think I was born yesterday? No.
* Will I really get 0 if I do the submission wrong? Like, what if I submit the .class instead of the .java?
    * Yes, you'll really get a **ZERO**.
