* There are two important, but simple ideas at the root of mergesort
    1. *Merging* two sorted lists, with the below idea, results in a single sorted list of all elements
    2. An empty list, or a list of size 1, is *sorted*



Merging Lists
-------------

1. Start with two sorted lists
2. Create an new empty list
3. Compare the first elements of the two lists
4. Remove the smaller of the two from its list and append it to the end of the new list
5. Go to 3


.. list-table:: Merge Example
    :widths: 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Two Sorted Lists
      - Merged List
    * - | :math:`2, 5, 8, 9`
        | :math:`1, 3, 4, 6, 7`
      -
    * - | :math:`2, 5, 8, 9`
        | :math:`3, 4, 6, 7`
      - :math:`1`
    * - | :math:`5, 8, 9`
        | :math:`3, 4, 6, 7`
      - :math:`1, 2`
    * - | :math:`5, 8, 9`
        | :math:`4, 6, 7`
      - :math:`1, 2, 3`
    * - | :math:`5, 8, 9`
        | :math:`6, 7`
      - :math:`1, 2, 3, 4`
    * - | :math:`8, 9`
        | :math:`6, 7`
      - :math:`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
    * - | :math:`8, 9`
        | :math:`7`
      - :math:`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`
    * - | :math:`8, 9`
        |
      - :math:`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`
    * - |
        |
      - :math:`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`

* In the last two rows, since the second list was empty, we know the remainder of the first list could simply be appended to the merged list


Splitting Lists
---------------

* The merge algorithm requires sorted lists to start from
* However, when given an unsorted collection to sort, there are no sorted lists to start merging
* Fortunately this is trivial to address
    * Keep splitting the unsorted collection in half

* Eventually this will result in a set of lists that are either empty or size 1

    :math:`[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]`

    :math:`[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g]`

    :math:`[a, b], [c, d], [e, f], [g]`

    :math:`[a, b], [c, d], [e, f], [g]`

    :math:`[a], [b], [c], [d], [e], [f], [g], []`


Putting it Back Together Again
------------------------------

* To get to the single sorted list, simply merge all the smaller sorted lists together until 1 list remains


    :math:`[t], [u], [v], [w], [x], [y], [z], []`

    :math:`[t, u], [v, w], [x, y], [z]`

    :math:`[t, u, v, w], [x, y, z]`

    :math:`[t, u, v, w, x, y, z]`


Recursively Thinking
--------------------

* The beauty of this algorithm is it's simplicity when thinking about it recursively

* **Mergesort**
    * If the list is size 0 or 1
        * Return the sorted list of size 0 or 1
    * Otherwise
        * Split the list into a first and second half
        * Sort the first half with **Mergesort**
        * Sort the second half with **Mergesort**
        * Merge the first and second half back together
        * Return the sorted merged list


Complexity Analysis
-------------------

* A simple way to think about the analysis is to consider
    * How much work is involved for a single merging of two lists
    * How many times merging needs to happen

* It can get more nuanced, but this level of detail is sufficient


Merging
^^^^^^^

* We will have two lists of roughly the same size to merge into one
* The algorithm compares elements and eventually adds them all to a new, sorted merged list
    * Interestingly, the elements in the merged list never need to be compared to one another again
* The complexity of merging is :math:`O(n)`


Number of Merges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: img/sort_split.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center


* If you remember from binary search, we can visualize the splitting of data as a tree
* On each level of the tree, there are a total of :math:`n` elements to be merged into larger lists
* You will also remember, when repeatedly halving, the relationship between :math:`n` and the number of levels in the tree is :math:`O(log_{2}(n))`
* Therefore, we need to do :math:`O(n)` work a total of :math:`O(log_{2}(n))` times --- :math:`O(n log_{2}(n))`


Quicksort
=========

.. image:: img/sort_quicksort.gif
   :width: 333 px
   :align: center
   :target: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort


* There are two important ideas at the root of quicksort
    1. Given a list of sorted values :math:`< x`, and another list of sorted values :math:`> x`, one can concatenate the first and second lists to create a larger sorted list
        * e.g.
            :math:`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` & :math:`[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

            :math:`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

    2. An empty list, or a list of size 1, is *sorted*


Pivoting
--------

* In order to append sorted lists together, we need sorted lists
* However, when given an unsorted collection to sort, there are no sorted lists to start concatenating
* Fortunately there is a simple way to do this
    * Repeat the following idea until left with lists of size 1 or 0

1. Select a *pivot* element in the list
2. Place all elements less than the pivot into a list
3. Place all elements larger than the pivot into a list

* Example:

    :math:`[4, 3, 8, 6, 0, 1, 9, 2, 7, 5]`

    :math:`[4, 3, 0, 1, 2], [5], [8, 6, 9, 7]`

    :math:`[0, 1], [2], [4, 3], [5], [6], [7], [8, 9]`

    :math:`[0], [1], [], [2], [], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], []`


* Note that, in the above example:
    1. For simplicity, the last element of each list was selected as the pivot
    2. When there were no elements less than/greater than the pivot, an empty list was shown

* You may also notice that one could start concatenating the lists together to result in a sorted collection


Recursively Thinking
--------------------

* **Quicksort**
    * If the list is size 0 or 1
        * Return the sorted list of size 0 or 1
    * Otherwise
        * Select a pivot
        * Put all elements less than the pivot into a list
        * Put all elements greater than the pivot into a second list
        * Sort the first list with **Quicksort**
        * Sort the second list with **Quicksort**
        * Concatenate the sorted first list, the pivot, and the sorted second list together
        * Return the sorted concatenated list


Complexity Analysis
-------------------

* The analysis of this algorithm gets interesting since it ends up depending a lot on the pivot


Good Pivots
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: img/sort_split.png
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center


* *If* we end up with pivots such that the first and second lists have roughly the same size, then the analysis ends up similar to mergesort
    * In other words, the pivot ends up being the median, or roughly the median value in the list
    * This means that roughly half the values are less than the pivot, and the other half are greater than the pivot

* Like mergesort, the list sizes roughly half each time, thus the height of the tree is :math:`log_{2}(n)`
    * :math:`1028 \rightarrow 512 \rightarrow 256 \rightarrow 128 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1`
    * Notice in the above example, it took only 10 steps to get to 1
    * If it was linear, it would have taken 1027 steps
        * :math:`1028 \rightarrow 1027 \rightarrow 1026 \rightarrow 1025 \rightarrow ...`

* Concatenating these lists is linear --- :math:`O(n)`


Bad Pivots
^^^^^^^^^^


Heapsort
========


Radix Sort
==========

* So far we have seen sorting algorithms that work based on comparing elements to other elements to determine where they should go
* However, it is actually possible to sort elements without ever comparing them to any other element

* The general idea is to group numbers based on individual digits
    * *Radix* means base, like base 10 numbers

* You may go from least significant to most significant digit, or *vice versa*
    * Here, we start with the least significant

* This strategy is probably best explained with an example
* Given an unsorted list, create a bin for each digit and place each element into the bin with the matching least significant digit

.. list-table:: Radix Sort Example Part 1
    :widths: 50 50

    * - :math:`44, 33, 11, 22, 154, 10, 1, 43, 99, 47`
      - :math:`\{10\} \{11, 1\} \{22\} \{33, 43\} \{44, 154\} \{\} \{\} \{47\} \{\} \{99\}`


* The next steps are to concatenate the bins and continue this process, but for each digit, moving left to right
    * Add leading zeros if needed

.. list-table:: Radix Sort Example Part 2
    :widths: 50 50

    * - :math:`10, 11, 01, 22, 33, 43, 44, 154, 47, 99`
      - :math:`\{01\} \{10, 11\} \{22\} \{33\} \{43, 44, 47\} \{154\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{99\}`
    * - :math:`001, 010, 011, 022, 033, 043, 044, 047, 154, 099`
      - :math:`\{001, 010, 011, 022, 033, 043, 044, 047, 099\} \{154\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\}`
    * - :math:`0001, 0010, 0011, 0022, 0033, 0043, 0044, 0047, 0154, 0099`
      - :math:`\{0001, 0010, 0011, 0022, 0033, 0043, 0044, 0047, 0099, 0154\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\} \{\}`

* Once we end up with the bin for zero being size :math:`n`, we're done

    :math:`1, 10, 11, 22, 33, 43, 44, 47, 99, 154`


Computational Complexity
------------------------

* Assuming:
    * We have a collection of :math:`n` things that need to be sorted
    * The longest number to be sorted has :math:`w` symbols
        * E.g. the number of digits in the base 10 numbers

* Each of the :math:`n` elements need to be placed in their correct bin
    * Assuming the use of a dictionary, this will take :math:`n` :math:`O(1)` operations
    * Therefore, :math:`O(n)`

* This process needs to be repeated for each symbol
    * :math:`O(n * w)`
    * This is typically how the computational complexity is expressed for radix sort

* It is possible that in your case the length of the numbers :math:`w` is fixed and reasonably small, so sometimes people will treat this like a constant
    * If one thinks of it this way, the complexity *could* be interpreted as :math:`O(n)`


.. note::

    The radix value does have an impact on the algorithm too (e.g. base 10 numbers vs. base 16); however, (a) it mostly
    impacts the space complexity, (b) it will only impact the computational complexity if a naive strategy of a linear
    search is used to place elements in the correct bins, and (c) the radix value is very likely to be small and fixed,
    thereby making it effectively a constant.
