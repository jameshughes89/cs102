Topic #24 --- Linked Binary Search Trees
****************************************

* Since we know the idea behind the binary search tree, we can now implement one
* Given the way the binary search tree ideas were presented, a linked implementation may feel like an obvious choice
    * Though, there is nothing stopping us from implementing one with an array

* If you have not yet, look at the :download:`BinarySearchTree <../main/java/BinarySearchTree.java>` interface
* Look at the :download:`LinkedBinarySearchTree <../main/java/LinkedBinarySearchTree.java>` implementation
