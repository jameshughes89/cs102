Topic #24 --- Linked Binary Search Trees
****************************************

* Since we know the idea behind the binary search tree, we can now implement one
* Given the way the binary search tree ideas were presented, a linked implementation may feel like an obvious choice
    * Though, there is nothing stopping us from implementing one with an array


Constructors
============

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    import java.util.Iterator;
    import java.util.NoSuchElementException;

    public class LinkedBinarySearchTree<T extends Comparable<? super T>> implements BinarySearchTree<T> {

        private int size;
        private Node<T> root;

        public LinkedBinarySearchTree() {
            root = null;
            size = 0;
        }

        public LinkedBinarySearchTree(T element) {
            this();
            add(element);
        }

* Like the other implementations, we will be sure to ``implement`` the interface
* We want the data structure to be generic
* And, like the sorted bag, since we are concerned with the ordering, we will ensure that our objects are comparable

* Here we have two constructors
    * A default constructor, which just sets up an empty binary search tree
    * A constructor that we could give an element to be the tree's root
        * This constructor is probably unnecessary, but let's keep it

* If you have not yet, look at the :download:`BinarySearchTree <../main/java/BinarySearchTree.java>` interface
* Look at the :download:`LinkedBinarySearchTree <../main/java/LinkedBinarySearchTree.java>` implementation
* Read Chapter 11 Sections 1 -- 3
