* Notice how the top element is the most general of all things included
* As you move down the tree, the things get more and more specific
* But as you move down, the things are still a type of the element at the top
    * In our bag examples, a ``SortedBag`` *is a* ``Bag``

    * But we should be careful not to translate what makes sense in real life to our code
