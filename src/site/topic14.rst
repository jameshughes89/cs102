Topic #14 --- Inheritance
*************************




Terminology
===========

* The class that is being inherited *from* is referred to as the **superclass**
    * Parent class
    * Base class

* The class that is inheriting from a superclass is called the **subclass**
    * Child class
    * Derived class

* When considering the hierarchies, these terms are relative
    * A ``SortedBag`` is a subclass of a ``Bag``
    * A ``Bag`` is a superclass of a ``IndexedBag``
    * An ``Object`` is also a superclass of ``Bag``, ``SortedBag``, and ``IndexedBag``
