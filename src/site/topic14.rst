Topic #14 --- Inheritance
*************************

* Inheritance is a way to derive a new class from an existing one
* This allows us to *inherit* functionality from the original class

* Consider the hierarchies below
* Notice how the top element is the most general of all things included
* As you move down the three, the things get more and more specific
* But as you move down, the things are still a type of the element at the top
    * A ``SortedBag`` *is a* ``Bag``

* This hierarchical thinking exists in real life too,
    * But we should be careful not to translate what makes sense in real life to our code
