* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab
* Ensure I have recorded your completion. Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective


Playing with Objects
====================

We will make a program that will keep track of a collection of courses offered at StFX. To do this we will write two
classes that, one for keeping track of the information about a single course, and another for keeping track of multiple
courses.


Course Class
------------

A ``Course`` is a simple object that keeps track of data for us.

1. Create a class called ``Course`` that has three private fields: ``programCode``, ``courseCode``, and ``courseTitle``
    * For example, this course would have the following values for the fields
        * ``programCode`` --- ``"CSCI"``
        * ``courseCode`` --- ``"162"``
        * ``courseTitle`` --- ``"Programming and Data Structures"``

2. Write a single constructor to take and assign values to the fields

3. Write getters and setters for each field

4. Write a ``toString`` method that returns ``programCode``, followed by a space, followed by the ``courseCode``
    * ``"CSCI 162"``

5. Write ``equals`` that checks if two ``Course`` objects are equivalent
    * We will say that two courses are the same if their ``programCode`` and ``courseCode`` are the same
    * Remember to be careful with ``==``

6. Test the ``Course`` class by making a few instances of them and calling the methods and see if they work as you expect


Course List Class
-----------------

A ``CourseList`` will be a collection of ``Course`` objects that we can add and remove from.

1. Make a ``CourseList`` class that has two private fields (``list`` and ``size``) and a constant for a default capacity
    * ``list`` will be an array that holds references to ``Course`` objects
    * ``size`` will be the number of ``Courses`` currently in ``list``
        * Remember, the capacity of the array and ``size`` are not the same thing
    * ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY`` is a constant that will be used for creating the ``list`` array if no capacity is provided

2. Write two constructors
    * One that takes no parameter and makes ``list`` based on ``DEFAULT_CAPACITY``
    * The other takes a parameter ``initialCapacity`` for the capacity of ``list``
    * Try to use *constructor chaining*

3. Write an ``add`` method that takes the necessary parameters to create a new ``Course`` object and add it to the collection
    * You will need to also make a private ``expandCapacity`` method for ``add`` to work properly

4. Write a ``remove`` method that takes the necessary parameters to find and remove a ``Course`` from the collection
    * You may want to make use of the ``Course`` object's ``equals`` method

5. Write a ``size`` method to return the number of ``Course`` objects in the collection

6. Write a reasonable ``toString`` for the class

7. Test the ``CourseList`` class by calling the methods
