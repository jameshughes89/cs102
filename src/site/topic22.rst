Binary Tree Definition
======================

* A **binary** tree is one where each node has no more than two (2) children
    * 2-ary tree
    * Tree with a degree/arity of 2

* If a node has children, they are referred to as the *left* and *right* children
    * Which are also referred to as the left and right subtrees
    * In the above example, *B* is the left subtree and *C* is the right subtree of *A*

* In a binary tree, position matters --- it matters if a subtree is the left or right

* A recursive definition of a binary tree is
    * An empty tree
    * Or, a tree that has a root whose left and right subtrees are binary trees

* Have a look at the :download:`BinaryTree <../main/java/BinaryTree.java>` interface
* Read Chapter 10 Sections 4 -- 7
    * 34 pages (mostly code though)
