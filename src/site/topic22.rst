Binary Tree Definition

Traversals
==========


Pre-order

In-order
-------


Post-order
---------


Level-order
-----------


Iterative Pre/In/Post-Order
---------------------------

* With the iterative level-order traversal, we used a *queue*
* What do you think would happen if we switched it out for a stack?

* With the recursive pre-/in-/post-order traversals, we used the call stack
    * We didn't need a software stack, but we could have used one

* How would we change the level-order traversal to do a pre-/in-/post-order traversal?

For next time
=============

* Have a look at the :download:`BinaryTree <../main/java/BinaryTree.java>` interface
* Read Chapter 10 Sections 4 -- 7
    * 34 pages (mostly code though)
