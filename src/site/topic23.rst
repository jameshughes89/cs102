Topic #23 --- Binary Search Trees
*********************************

* Now that we have covered binary trees, we can look at more specific types of binary trees
    * Namely, the binary *search* tree

* Compared to a binary tree, binary *search* trees have specific properties and constraints that must be followed
* We can take advantage of these properties and constraints for extra improvements in certain functionality


Binary Search Tree Definition
=============================

* A binary *search* tree is a binary tree where:
    * All values in the left subtree are less than the value in the root node
    * All values in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the value in the root node

.. note::

    We could make the left subtree less than or equal to and the right subtree strictly greater than too. All that
    matters is that only on subtree includes the *equal to* part.

    Alternatively, we could make the right subtree exclusively greater than, but this would disallow duplicates.

* In the above example, the tree on the left is **not** a binary search tree since a value in the left subtree of the subtree with root 15 is greater than it (16)
* The left tree is an example of a binary search tree

* In the above example, note that the leftmost node is the smallest value in the tree and the rightmost is the largest.


A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree
-------------------------------------

* A binary search tree is a special case of a binary tree
    * Therefore, it will have all the operations we would want our binary tree to have

* But we will have a few additional operations
    * Add, but based on the important ordering
    * Remove, but must preserve ordering
    * Remove max
    * Remove min


Searching a Binary Search Tree
==============================

* The special ordering property allows us to search for items within the binary search tree more efficiently than a regular search through a tree

Naive Search
------------

* Since the binary search tree is a binary tree, we could use the search presented in the previous topic
* Remember that this search strategy has a computational complexity of :math:`O(n)`, where :math:`n` is the number of nodes in the tree

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    public boolean contains(T needle) {
        return contains(root, needle);
    }

    private boolean contains(Node<T> current, T needle) {
        if (current == null) {
            return false;
        } else if (current.getData().equals(needle)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return contains(current.getLeft(), needle) || contains(current.getRight(), needle);
        }
    }
