Topic #23 --- Binary Search Trees
*********************************

* Now that we have covered binary trees, we can look at more specific types of binary trees
    * Namely, the binary *search* tree

* Compared to a binary tree, binary *search* trees have specific properties and constraints that must be followed
* We can take advantage of these properties and constraints for extra improvements in certain functionality
