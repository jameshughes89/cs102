Topic #18 --- Memory & The Call Stack
*************************************


Memory Allocation
=================

* Memory is broken down into two broad sections

1. The Stack
    * Stores information about the current method running
        * Local variables
        * Formal parameters
        * Return address

2. The Heap
    * Which can be broken down further into storage for
    a. Static information
        * e.g. your code
    b. Instance information
        * e.g. Objects
        * Technically, in Java, this can be broken down further into an area for longer living objects and an area for younger ones
            * We will ignore this here

* For example, if I were to run ``SortedBag<T> myBag = new ArraySortedBag<>();`` in my main method
    * The information on what an ``ArraySortedBag`` is is stored in the static area of the heap
    * The ``ArraySortedBag`` that is created is put into the instance area of the heap
    * The reference variable ``myBag`` is stored in the stack
