Topic #18 --- Memory & The Call Stack
*************************************


* When running programs on our computer, memory is used and accessed in different ways
* Typically, we physically store instructions *and* data in the same address space
    * Note that there are other architectures/strategies one could use for a computational system

* This could be a recipe for disaster, but our modern systems have strategies for mitigating this
* For many programming languages, Java included, we logically separate out memory into areas for
    * Instructions
        * e.g. Classes & Interfaces
    * Dynamically allocated stuff
        * e.g. Objects
    * Stuff related to what is currently happening
        * e.g. Variables & parameters
