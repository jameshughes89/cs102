* Variables we make in our program go into RAM

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    int anInt = 5;

* This makes a variable called ``anInt`` and assigns it the value ``5``
* The value ``5`` is stored in RAM somewhere, and we use the label ``anInt`` to access it
* Generally, where in RAM the value is actually stored is up to the operating system
* But a neat thing about C++ is that we can ask *where* in RAM the value is stored
