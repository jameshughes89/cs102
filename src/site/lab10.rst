    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

Heaps
=====

Have you ever wanted to store a binary tree in an array?

* The root of the tree is always at index :math:`0`
* Given an element at index :math:`i`
    * Its left child can be found at :math:`2i + 1`
    * Its right child can be found at :math:`2i + 2`
    * Assuming it's not the root, it's parent can be found at :math:`\lfloor (i-1)/2 \rfloor`
        * :math:`\lfloor x \rfloor` just means to round down if needed

* For example, consider the element 17 located at index :math:`3` in the array
    * Left child would be at :math:`3*2 + 1 = 7`
    * Right child would be at :math:`3*2 + 2 = 8`
    * Parent would be at :math:`\lfloor (3-1)/2 \rfloor = 1`
