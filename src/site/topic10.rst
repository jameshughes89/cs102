    * Things are added to one end (rear or tail)
    * Things are removed from the other end (front or head)

* This is *First in First out* (FIFO)

* Given this, the **F**\ irst thing **I**\ n will be the **F**\ irst thing **O**\ ut
    * FIFO

* For example, any ordinary single file line you have ever lined up in
