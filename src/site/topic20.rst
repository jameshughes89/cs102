Topic #20 --- Searching
***********************

* For our needs, we will say we want to search for a specified *thing* in *something* and know if it exists there or not
* For example, does a given number exist within an array of numbers
    * We will use this version of the problem here

* If we want to write an algorithm to solve this problem, all we really need is something that tells us if it's there or not
    * That's all that's required
    * We could write any algorithm that works

* However, we're going to look at two intuitive ideas that all of you have, more or less, used in one way or another many times in your life
    * Linear Search
    * Interpolation Search
        * We will discuss a specific kind of interpolation search called a *binary search*
