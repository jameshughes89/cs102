Collections and ADTs
====================

Abstraction
===========

* A really big idea for problem solving is *abstraction*
    * You do this a lot in every day life

* We will try to separate the **WHAT** from the **HOW**
    * What we can do
    * How it's actually done

* We know *what* we have to do to drive a car, but we don't need to know *how* the card does what it does
* We know that we wanted to append things to lists in Python, but you didn't need to know how the Python list does that

* The above ADTs are all just the *what*
    * We can add and remove stuff to a list
    * This is how we *interface* with the thing

* At no point do we talk about *how* or *implement* these ADTs actually do their thing
    * In fact, maybe there are multiple options for *how* for a given *what*


Layering
--------

* If our systems are large, we may start to have multiple levels, or, *layers*, of abstraction
* If this is the case, we may want to group our components and restrict how our layers of abstraction interact

* In real life, we can play the layers game
    * Tell me how to cook pasta?
        * Boil salted water and then add pasta
    * Tell me in more detail
        * Get a pot, fill with water, put on stove, and ....
    * ...
    * ...
    * ...
    * Tell me in more detail
        * Neurons start to fire and muscles contract...
    * MORE DETAIL
        * Ion pumps and ....

* The point is, it's `*turtles all the way down*<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress>`_
* If I want to make pasta for dinner, I don't care, and I don't want to care about ion pumps
