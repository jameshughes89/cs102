Collections and ADTs
====================

Abstraction
===========

* A really big idea for problem solving is *abstraction*
    * You do this a lot in every day life

* We will try to separate the **WHAT** from the **HOW**
    * What we can do
    * How it's actually done

* We know *what* we have to do to drive a car, but we don't need to know *how* the card does what it does
* We know that we wanted to append things to lists in Python, but you didn't need to know how the Python list does that

* The above ADTs are all just the *what*
    * We can add and remove stuff to a list
    * This is how we *interface* with the thing

* At no point do we talk about *how* or *implement* these ADTs actually do their thing
    * In fact, maybe there are multiple options for *how* for a given *what*
