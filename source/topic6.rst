Topic #6 --- ArrayStack
***********************

* We now are familiar with *what* we want the stack ADT to do without talking about *how*
* Obviously, in order to use a stack in Java, we need to actually implement a stack

* We now need to think about implementation issues
    * How are we going to keep track of our data?
    * How will we know where the top is?
        * This will depend on the choice of how we store the data

Implementing a Stack --- Array Container
========================================

* We've already seen that arrays are great for storing contiguous data

   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

* If this is the case, how should we keep track of the top of the stack?

* What are the pros and cons of making keeping the top index 0?
* What are the pros and cons of making the top the other end?
