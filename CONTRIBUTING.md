## This is a First Year Course

Keep content contributions at an appropriate level for students.

At this stage they should be familiar with:
* Variables
* Types
* I/O
* Functions
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Strings
* Arrays/Lists (linear collection)
* Objects
* A little searching and sorting  
* A little complexity analysis
* Very little recursion

The core learning objectives and topics for this course are:
* Abstraction
* Objects 
* Linked Structures  
* Linear Data Structures
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Lists
* Nonlinear Data Structures
    * Some Trees
* Interfaces
* Inheritance
* Iterators  
* Algorithm Analysis
* Recursion
* Searching and Sorting Algorithms

Topics at a similar level that are considered out of scope may be:
* General Inserts/Removals from a Tree
* Self-Balancing Trees  
* Graphs
* Graph Algorithms
* Hashing/Maps

Although no programming language is a learning objective, Java-*isms* are presented where necessary. Additional Java design ideas are welcome, but keep them simple enough to be accessible for the level of student.

## How to Contribute
### Issues
* Use issues to point out bugs/issues
* Use issues to suggest enhancements
* Use issues to suggest content
* Use issues to suggest changes

### Pull Requests
* Fork and submit PRs to contribute to the repo

### Submitting a Good Issue/Pull Request
* Complete the provided template by leaving the headers filling in the sections
* Communicate effectively
    * If we cannot understand, it will not be addressed
* Use the style guide below
* [Link to any relevant issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)  
* Not all headers make sense in all cases, remove header where appropriate
    * If you feel it necessary to include the header still, write N/A or Self-Explanatory where appropriate 

## Style Guidelines

* Use present tense
    * Good: "Add", "Change", "Update", "Remove"
    * Bad: "Added", "Changing", "Updated", "Removing"
* Keep messages brief, but descriptive
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* If appropriate, include Topic# in titles
  * e.g., _Topic4 Add details on ..._
* Feel free to use the following emojis (multiple where applicable):
    * :new: `:new:` New feature, content, files, or request
    * :bomb: `:bomb:` Remove feature, content, or files
    * :mortar_board: `:mortar_board:` Related to course content (topics, code, assignments, etc.)
    * :memo: `:memo:` Documentation related (repo stuff)
    * :robot: `:robot:` Related to deploying the website
    * :lipstick: `:lipstick:` Improving the format/structure/layout of content/files
    * :bug: `:bug:` Bug in Code or Typo
    * :telescope: `:telescope:` Using different words/code for the same ideas
    * :art: `:art:` Relating to figures/images
    * :dancers: `:dancers:` This issue or pull request already exists
    * :medal_sports: `:medal_sports:` Good for newcomers
    * :eyes: `:eyes:` Extra attention is needed
    * :question: `:question:` Further information is requested
